  - Make layouts control their widgets geometries
  - Pros of being widgets:
    - Can have layouts as children widgets of other widgets
    - Can have layouts as children of layouts for nestedness greatness
  - Cons:
    - They aren't really widgets... or are they?
- Form layout
  - A two column by N lines grid 
- Grid layout
  - Can put widgets in any place in the grid
- Horizontal and vertical layouts
- Nested layouts
